# Docker and Python - Homework 7 - Make Up Assignment 

For this assignment, I have combined Docker with Python to create a program that generates a QR code PNG file containing a URL. The QR code can be scanned with a mobile phone camera, directing users to the target website. The program generates a QR code that takes someone to my GitHub homepage i.e. [https://github.com/john-pineda](https://github.com/john-pineda).

## Setup
1.  Go to Docker.com and Install Docker - [https://www.docker.com/get-started/](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
2.  Sign up for your own Docker account 

## Submission Requirements:

1. Add the QR code image that links to your own GitHub homepage that you generate to the readme.md file, so that it appears below.
